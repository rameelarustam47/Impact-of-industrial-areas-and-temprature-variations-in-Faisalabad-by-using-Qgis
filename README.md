# Impact-of-industrial-areas-and-temprature-variations-in-Faisalabad-by-using-Qgis
 This project aims to analyze the spatial relationship between industrial areas and surface temperature variations in Faisalabad using remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) tools.
This repository contains geospatial data, analysis scripts, and visualizations for assessing the impact of industrial areas on land surface temperature (LST) in Faisalabad, Pakistan. The project uses Google Earth Engine (GEE) to generate yearly LST rasters and QGIS for mapping and spatial analysis of major industrial clusters, including Nishat Mills, Interloop, Kamal Limited, and others. The repository includes:

CSV files of major industries with coordinates and tehsil information.

GEE scripts to extract and process MODIS LST data for Faisalabad.

QGIS-ready raster and point layers for visualization of temperature patterns across industrial and rural areas.

Documentation explaining the methodology and interpretation of surface temperature variations, highlighting urban heat island effects and land-use impacts.

Purpose:

Study the relationship between industrial distribution and surface temperature.

Provide a GIS-ready dataset for further research on urban heat islands, climate, and urban planning in Faisalabad.

Serve as a case study for remote sensing and spatial analysis using open-source tools.

Technologies:

Google Earth Engine (JavaScript API)

Python (for CSV generation and data processing)

QGIS (mapping and visualization)
